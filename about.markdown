# John Parker
I make things that run on the web (mostly). I'm a career engineer and have been fortunate to have worked at several Fortune 100 companies. I co-founded [Scout Manager](https://www.scoutmanager.com) and I also work as a freelance consultant to help companies get a solid technical foundation within their organizations. 

If you'd like to get in touch, let's connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnathan-d-parker/).
